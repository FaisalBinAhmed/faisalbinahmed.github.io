				üìù When I'm not working or studying, I prefer to read books or
				write articles. I started writing in 2013 as a freelance tech
				writer. Soon I along with an Indian friend started a Windows
				application review website called 'MetroAppSauce' - focusing
				mainly on modern Windows Phone and WinRT applications. Much Like
				Windows Phone, our beloved project had to face its demise.
				<br />
				In 2017, I continued my writing career with a technology
				publication called Neowin. You can find all my written articles{' '}

				üìö I love reading - especially science related non-fiction
